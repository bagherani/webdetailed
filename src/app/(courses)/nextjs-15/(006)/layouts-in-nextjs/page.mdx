# Layouts in Next.js: Creating Shared Layouts and Preserving State
Layouts in Next.js provide a way to wrap content and share common elements, such as headers, footers, and sidebars, across multiple pages.

## Using the Root Layout

The **root layout** wraps all pages in a Next.js app, making it an ideal place for global components. To create one:

1. In the root `app` directory, add `layout.tsx`.
2. Define shared components like `Header` or `Footer` here.

For example:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  );
}
```

The layout wraps each page, ensuring that elements like the header persist across routes.

## Nested Layouts

You can create additional layouts for nested routes by adding `layout.tsx` in subdirectories:

1. Inside the `app/about` directory, create `layout.tsx` to add a specific layout for pages under `/about`.
2. The layout should return `children` to wrap content:

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';

   export default function AboutLayout({ children }) {
     return <div className="about-layout">{children}</div>;
   }
   ```

This will wrap every page in `/about` and its subdirectories, combining both the root and nested layouts.

## Preserving State Between Pages

Next.js layouts can preserve their state, which is useful for elements that maintain user data, like a shopping cart or user profile. This is enabled by soft navigation in Next.js:

- **Soft navigation**: Uses AJAX to fetch and update content without reloading the whole page.
- **Link component**: Use `<Link>` from Next.js for smooth navigation, which retains layout state.

### Example with State Preservation

To demonstrate state preservation, add a button to `Header` that increments a counter:

```tsx
"use client";

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Header() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <header>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click count: {count}</button>
      <nav>
        <Link href="/">Home</Link>
        <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}
```

Clicking the button increments the count, and navigating between pages retains this state.

## Benefits of Layouts in Next.js

- **Efficiency**: Shared components are defined once and applied across multiple pages.
- **State preservation**: Soft navigation keeps layout states intact, reducing reloads for dynamic content.
- **Structure**: Layouts organize page structures for easy maintenance.

Layouts help centralize shared elements and streamline navigation, improving both user experience and development efficiency.

In the next guide, weâ€™ll cover **templates** and explain the differences between templates and layouts in Next.js.

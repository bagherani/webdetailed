# Understanding URL Anatomy and Basic Routing in Next.js
In this guide, we’ll explore the structure of URLs and how to implement basic routing in a Next.js application.

## Anatomy of a URL

A URL is structured into several components, each with a specific purpose:

- **Protocol**: Specifies the communication protocol, e.g., `http`, `https`, or `ftp`.
- **Subdomain**: Optional; can be used for specific segments like `www` or `app`.
- **Domain Name**: The core part of the URL that represents the website.
- **Domain Extension**: Also called the **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**, e.g., `.com`, `.net`.
- **Path (Segments)**: Starting after the domain, this represents different sections of the website.
- **Query Parameters**: Key-value pairs used to pass data in the URL, e.g., `?id=123`.
- **Fragment**: Optional part following a `#`, used to link to specific sections on a page.

In Next.js, we primarily manage the **Path (Segments)** and have control over routing and structuring URLs in our application.

## Creating a Basic Page in Next.js

In Next.js, creating a route is as simple as adding a folder and file structure in the `app` directory. Let’s add a new page to our project as an example.

### Step 1: Running the Project

Ensure your Next.js project is running. Navigate to the home page to confirm everything is set up correctly.

### Step 2: Adding a New Page

To add a new route, follow these steps:

1. Go to the `app` directory.
2. Create a new folder, such as `about`. This folder will act as a path in the URL, e.g., `/about`.
3. Inside the `about` folder, add a `page.tsx` or `page.js` file.
4. Add content to `page.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';

   const AboutPage = () => {
     return <h1>About Page</h1>;
   };

   export default AboutPage;
   ```

   Next.js will automatically recognize this as the route for `/about`, and you can visit this URL to see the new page.

### Testing the Page

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/about` to verify the page. You should see the content of `AboutPage`.

## Nested Routes in Next.js

Next.js allows you to create nested routes by organizing your folders. Here’s how to add a nested route under `/about`:

1. Inside the `about` folder, create a new folder named `me`.
2. In the `me` folder, create another `page.tsx` file.
3. Update the content in `page.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';

   const AboutMePage = () => {
     return <h1>About Me Page</h1>;
   };

   export default AboutMePage;
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/about/me` to view the nested page.

## Next.js Page Component and Routing

Each page in Next.js exports a default function that represents the entry point of the webpage. The name of the function doesn’t impact the functionality, but using descriptive names like `AboutPage` improves code readability.

Next.js will automatically handle the routing based on the file structure, allowing you to build complex routes with minimal configuration.

This basic routing approach lets you set up a foundational structure in your Next.js app. Later, we’ll dive into dynamic routing, layouts, and templates.

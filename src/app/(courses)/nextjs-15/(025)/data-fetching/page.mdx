When building a modern web application, server-side data fetching is a common practice to gather information before delivering content to users. Next.js simplifies this by integrating the `fetch` API, along with features like caching, to enhance performance and developer experience.

#### Basic Fetch Example on the Server

To fetch data on the server, we call the `fetch` function with a URL. Here's a simple example of fetching blog posts:

```tsx
async function getPosts() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts");
  const posts = await response.json();
  return posts;
}
```

The above function fetches posts, parses the JSON response, and returns it. This ensures that the data is ready when the page is rendered.

#### Caching with the `fetch` API

Next.js supports advanced caching mechanisms with the `fetch` API. By default, fetch requests in development are not cached. However, you can control caching behavior using the `cache` option:

- **`force-cache`**: Caches the response and serves it from the cache.
- **`no-store`**: Disables caching, ensuring fresh data is fetched for every request.

Example with `force-cache`:

```tsx
const posts = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts", {
  cache: "force-cache",
});
```

This stores the response in a cache file within the `.next` folder, reducing redundant network requests in production.

#### Handling Dynamic Content

For dynamic routes or data, you can explicitly mark a page as dynamic:

```tsx
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
```

This tells Next.js to always fetch fresh data, even during production builds.

### Validating and Typing API Responses

Using third-party libraries like `zod`, you can validate and type-check the response data. Here's an example:

1. Install `zod`:
   ```bash
   npm install zod
   ```

2. Define a schema and validate the response:

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";

const PostSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  title: z.string(),
  author: z.string(),
});

const PostsSchema = z.array(PostSchema);

async function getValidatedPosts() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts");
  const data = await response.json();
  return PostsSchema.parse(data); // Validate and type-check
}
```

This ensures your data matches the expected structure, reducing runtime errors.

---

### Caching Database Queries with `cache`

To optimize server-side queries, React provides a `cache` function. It can memoize function results during the request-response cycle, preventing duplicate computations.

Example:

```tsx
import { cache } from "react";

const getUserById = cache(async (id) => {
  const user = await db.getUser(id); // Simulated database query
  return user;
});
```

When `getUserById` is called multiple times within the same request cycle, the result is fetched only once, saving resources.

#### Avoiding Multiple Cache Instances

To ensure consistent caching, wrap your database functions in a shared object rather than creating new cache instances:

```tsx
const db = {
  getUserById: cache(async (id) => {
    const user = await dbQuery(id);
    return user;
  }),
};

const user = await db.getUserById(1);
```

This approach centralizes caching logic and avoids redundant data fetching.

### Best Practices for Data Fetching

1. **Use Libraries for Efficiency**:
   Tools like `SWR` and `React Query` simplify client-side data fetching with features like caching, revalidation, and optimistic updates.

2. **Perform Parallel Fetching**:
   Fetch multiple resources simultaneously using `Promise.all` for better performance.

```tsx
const [posts, users] = await Promise.all([
  fetch("https://api.example.com/posts").then((res) => res.json()),
  fetch("https://api.example.com/users").then((res) => res.json()),
]);
```

3. **Validate Data**:
   Always validate API responses, especially when dealing with external sources.

## Fetching Data in Client-Side Components

Fetching data on the client side in a React application involves certain considerations, especially regarding performance, error handling, and best practices. This guide explores various methods, highlighting the recommended approaches.

### Direct Fetch with `useEffect`

Using `fetch` within `useEffect` is the simplest way to fetch data in client-side components. However, it has limitations, such as lack of caching and the need for additional logic for error handling and loading states.

#### Example Implementation

```tsx
"use client";

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const List = () => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch("/api/users");
        const data = await response.json();
        setUsers(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>
          {user.name}, {user.age}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default List;
```

This approach works but is not ideal for several reasons:
- It requires custom error and loading state handling.
- The logic is tightly coupled to the component, making it less reusable.

### Handling Cross-Origin Issues

When fetching data from another domain, browsers may block the request due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. To bypass this, you can proxy the request through a server-side API in your application.

#### Example of a Proxy API

```tsx
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET() {
  const users = [{ id: 1, name: "John", age: 30 }, { id: 2, name: "Jane", age: 25 }];
  return NextResponse.json(users);
}
```

This API can be called from the client without encountering CORS issues.

### Recommended Approach: Using SWR

SWR (stale-while-revalidate) is a React hook library for data fetching that simplifies state management, caching, and revalidation.

#### Installation

Install SWR using npm:

```bash
npm install swr
```

#### Implementation with SWR

```tsx
"use client";

import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());

const List = () => {
  const { data: users, error, isLoading } = useSWR("/api/users", fetcher);

  if (error) return <div>Error loading data.</div>;
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>
          {user.name}, {user.age}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default List;
```

SWR provides:
- **Caching**: Prevents redundant API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error states.
- **Loading State**: Simple and declarative loading indicators.

### Optimizing Data Fetching

To further optimize data fetching, you can:
1. **Separate Concerns**: Move data-fetching logic to a service layer.
2. **Error Handling**: Use try-catch blocks with custom error messages.
3. **Clean Architecture**: Format and prepare server data before consumption.


## Conclusion
Leveraging these techniques ensures a robust and efficient data fetching strategy in your Next.js applications. Whether working with APIs or databases, proper use of caching and validation can significantly improve your app's performance and maintainability.

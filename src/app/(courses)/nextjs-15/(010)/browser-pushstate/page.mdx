# Work with the Browser history and pushState function in Next.js

When building interactive web applications, efficient client-side navigation is essential. Next.js offers powerful tools to manage URL states, allowing for dynamic and responsive page elements without requiring page reloads. One such tool is the `window.history` API, which enables you to manipulate the browser history state and update the URL seamlessly. This article will guide you through using `pushState` to create dynamic modals with Tailwind CSS and manage their states efficiently in Next.js, inspired by the Google Images preview experience.

## Working with the `window.history` API

To enhance the user experience, we’ll explore the `window.history.pushState()` method. This function allows you to push a new state to the browser history without reloading the page. Let’s implement this in a gallery-style preview modal, ensuring it behaves like native navigation, even using the back and forward buttons to open and close modals.

### Step 1: Building the Layout with Tailwind CSS

First, we’ll create a responsive grid layout with Tailwind CSS, reserving space for a preview modal that appears on item selection. By dynamically adjusting the grid columns, the layout adapts based on the modal state.

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <div className="col-span-2">
    {/* Gallery items go here */}
  </div>
  <div className={`col-span-1 ${isPreviewOpen ? 'block' : 'hidden'}`}>
    {/* Modal content here */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Step 2: Implementing `pushState` for Modal State Management

When a user selects an item, we’ll open a modal by updating the URL state. This is done using `window.history.pushState`, which can add query parameters like `isPreviewOpen=true` without a page reload.

```tsx
function openModal() {
  window.history.pushState({}, '', '?isPreviewOpen=true');
  setIsPreviewOpen(true);
}

function closeModal() {
  window.history.pushState({}, '', '?isPreviewOpen=false');
  setIsPreviewOpen(false);
}
```

This code updates the URL query parameters, preserving the user’s navigation flow. Clicking the back button reverses the `pushState` and closes the modal, making the experience seamless.

### Step 3: Making It React to URL Changes with `useSearchParams`

In Next.js, you can use the `useSearchParams` hook to manage URL query parameters and observe their changes. By monitoring the `isPreviewOpen` parameter, we can determine whether to show the preview modal based on the current URL state.

```tsx
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';

const isPreviewOpen = searchParams.get('isPreviewOpen') === 'true';
```

With this approach, the URL directly dictates the modal’s open/closed state. This persistence allows the modal state to survive page refreshes, providing a consistent user experience.

### Step 4: Setting up State-Dependent Components with `useEffect`

To track and respond to URL changes dynamically, you can combine `useEffect` with `useSearchParams`. Whenever the URL changes, our component re-renders accordingly.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const [isPreviewOpen, setIsPreviewOpen] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const previewState = searchParams.get('isPreviewOpen') === 'true';
  setIsPreviewOpen(previewState);
}, [searchParams]);
```

This approach keeps our UI state in sync with the URL, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the `window.history` state.

### Step 5: Managing State Data with `window.history.state`

The `window.history.pushState` function accepts a data parameter that can be used to store additional information. For example, when opening a specific item in the modal, you can pass the item ID and retrieve it later without cluttering the URL.

```tsx
function openItemPreview(itemId) {
  window.history.pushState({ itemId }, '', `?isPreviewOpen=true`);
}

function getPreviewItem() {
  const state = window.history.state;
  return state ? state.itemId : null;
}
```

Using `window.history.state` enables you to store additional data about the selected item without modifying the URL further, keeping the navigation cleaner and more organized.

### Observing State Changes with `useEffect`

Next.js doesn’t automatically re-render components when `window.history.state` changes, so you’ll need to manually observe these changes. Here’s how you can set up `useEffect` to watch for changes in `window.history.state`.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleStateChange = () => {
    const state = window.history.state;
    if (state && state.itemId) {
      setSelectedItem(state.itemId);
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener('popstate', handleStateChange);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('popstate', handleStateChange);
  };
}, []);
```

Adding an event listener for `popstate` keeps the component updated as the user navigates back and forth, retrieving the current state seamlessly.

## Wrapping Up

The `window.history` API allows for efficient client-side navigation, enabling developers to build smooth, dynamic experiences in Next.js. By combining `pushState` with `useSearchParams` and `useEffect`, you can ensure that stateful UI components, like modals or sidebars, persist across page refreshes and adapt to URL changes responsively.

This approach not only enhances navigation but also improves user experience by making it intuitive and visually cohesive.
